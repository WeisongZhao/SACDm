## Declaration
<!-- This repository contains the java source code (Maven) for <b>SACD</b> imagej plugin.  This plugin is for the <b>Simplified SACD</b> (w/o sparse deconvolution), and is also accompanied with conventional <b>SOFI</b> calculation. The development of this imagej plugin is work in progress, so expect rough edges. 

If you want to reproduce the results of SACD publication, the <b>SACDM</b> (Matlab version) is recommended. Due to the distance between the Fourier interpolation, deconvolution of <b>SACDj</b>, and <b>SACDM</b>, there may exist a gap between the results of <b>SACDM</b> and <b>SACDj</b>. To me, the implementations of  <b>SACDM</b>  are more flexible and accurate.  -->


<details>
<summary><b>Plans</b></summary>

- Full FRC assisted SACD;
- Another type of interpolation, 3D XC type calculation will be added.
